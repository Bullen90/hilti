Instructions
============

- Single return statement independent of whether we're returning a
value or not. 
  
- new T

Data Types
==========

- addresses and subnets
- string type is still missing instructions
- bytes 
- list

Infracstructure
===============

- Add garbage collector
- Complete exception support

- Returning values from C functions need to be reconsidered:

  (a) how to return *any* values? do we want to return type
      information as well?
      
  (b) looks like we need another decorator convertValueFromC() in
  addition to convertValueToC()

Cleanup
=======

- Implement "export" linkage: 
  * only exported functions get external LLVM linkage
  * otherwise, export implies everything "declare" does

- Mark internal libhilti functions with special linkage rather than
relying on "__"

- Remove labels' @-prefix

- Replace resolver's int-width derivation with usage of codegen's
 refine_to.

Documentation
=============

- More of the docstring derived text should be automatically
included without the need for manual auto* directives.

- We need to figure out a way to document the libhilti and generally
C-level stuff.
