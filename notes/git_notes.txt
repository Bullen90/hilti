Notes on using git:

Branches

git push origin <BRANCHNAME>
updates just the branch

likewise

git pull origin <BRANCHNAME>
fetches.


So can work in a branch fine and thats effective.

However, commit messages do go regardless of branch

Merging sort of works: It actually auto-merged the test bit fine, but
it really should have complained because the merge was ambiguous in
option.
