Code Structure
==============

- Introduce container type and derive "List" from it, moving all
general container functionality into the base blase (including
control hooks).

- I'm wondering whether lists (or more generally container should have a
UnitField as their type, rather than replicating all of a field's functionalty. 

- The &default attributes isn't handled consistently, as currently each type
needs to declare it supported itself. This attribute should generally be
supported for all types with ctors. 

- Likewise, other attributes might be suitable for automatic support
as well (e.g., &convert).

- Not sure the distinction between ParseableType and Type makes sense anymore.
We should move all of ParseableType into the baseclass and use validate() to
check whether features are used that only make sense within a unit field.
