BPTool - A command-line tool to run BinPAC analyzers stand-alone.
=================================================================

bptool is a little hack to run BinPAC generated analyzers on data
stored in files, usually just printing out the results. 

Installation
============

- First, you need to configure & compile BinPAC separately:

  * cd binpac 
  * ./configure && make
  
- Then running "make" in bptool/ should compile the bptool binary. 

Notes
=====

- To test the basic "test" analyzer, try:

    echo "Foo Bar" | ./bptool -a test -r /dev/stdin

- The BinPAC analyzers are in pac/*.pac. See pac/test.pac for a
  trivial example. All analyzers are statically compiled into
  bptool, so whenever you change any of the BinPAC grammars, you
  need to rerun make in the top-level directory. 
  
- The main use-case for bptool is to parse a data stream and then
  just print out the protocol fields. The analyzer in pac/test.pac
  follows this model and comes with some boiler-plate code that can
  simply be copied&pasted to start with new analyzer; just replace
  all the Test_* prefixes inside the boiler-plate. For a simple
  request/reply protocol, it should otherwise be sufficient to
  change the non-boiler-plate code from the example.
