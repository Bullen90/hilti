The HILTI Abstract Machine
==========================

..note:: The autogenerated is only as good as what's in the code,
         which isn't very great yet to a large degree ... Also, the
         automatic cross-referecing doesn't work yet, and it's
         unclear whether the custom ``hlt`` roles are fully
         functional (in particular regarding cross-referencing as
         well.)
