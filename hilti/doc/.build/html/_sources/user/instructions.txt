Instruction Set

In the follwing, we list the complete set of instructions that the
HILTI language provides. For reference, we give them with both their
textual mnemonic (as their are written in HITLI input files) and with 
their internal class names (as provided by the :ref:`HILTI Python
module <internals-python-module>`. We split group the list according
to the intructions prefixes.
