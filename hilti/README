INSTALL
=======

* Prerequisites:

  - Python 2.6 
  
    Note that for now the Python binary is called as "python2.6"
    because most distributions are still using a version < 2.6 as
    default. Most Python 2.6 packages seem to install a binary under
    this name though. If you don't have it after installing 2.6,
    just put a link into your PATH pointing to the right binary. 
    
  - LLVM 2.4
  
    http://llvm.org/releases/
  
  - LLVM-PY 0.5
  
    http://code.google.com/p/llvm-py/downloads/list
  
  - For generating the documentation:
    
    Sphinx 0.5.1, or (perhaps) current development:
    
    http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
    
    To get the repository version:
    
      - Checking out:
        hg clone http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        
      - Updating:
        hg pull http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx


* There's not much in terms of installing anything system-wide yet
  but you should be able to get the test-suite to pass rather easily:
  
  1. First, you need to build libhilti:
  
     > cd libhilti && make
     
     There shouldn't be any errors messages.
     
  2. Then just run the Makefile in tests:
  
     > cd tests && make
     
     All tests are supposed to pass. If there's a problem with a test,
     "./run-tester -d path/to/test" will give you debugging output. 

* Starting points

  - Documentation is located in doc/html but there's not much there
    yet. Working on it ...
  
  - Look at the HILTI source files in the tests/* subdirectories to
    see how HILTI programs look like.

  - Tools:

    * tools/hiltic is the HILTI->LLVM compiler
  
    * tools/hilti-build runs the whole chain
    HILTI-to-native-executable. 

  - Look at tests/run-tester to see what environment variables to
    set for running the HILTI tools.
