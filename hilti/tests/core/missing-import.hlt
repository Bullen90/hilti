# Make sure we need the "import Hilti". This is expected to fail.
# However, if the importing works incorrectly, Hilti::print might
# actually be known even without an import because internally we
# import hilti_intern.hlt, which in turn imports hilti.hlt. If the IDs
# from there get erroneously transfered to Main, then Hilti::print
# will be resolvable.
