// The command queue is an internal mechanism to serialize operations that
// must not be executed concurrently. Writers send commands to the queue, and
// a dedidacated manager threads then takes them out and executes the
// operations they describe.
//
// Note that communication is one way, there's no feedback from the queue
// manager to the threads issueing the commands.
//
// This interface is also available when running in a non-threaded
// environment; we then execute the commands synchronously when they are
// pushed into the queue.
//
// The queue mechanism is not visible at the HILTI level, this API is
// strictly internal.
