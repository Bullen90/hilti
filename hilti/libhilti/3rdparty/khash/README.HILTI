Changes to original version:

- We're using libhilti's memory management from libhilti/memory.h.

- We define kh_##name##_t outside of the Big Macros in map.h/set.h, and
  intergrate some additional fields in there so that we can use the struct as
  our hlt_map/set types directly (i.e., we save one memory allocation per
  instance).

- khint_t changed from uint32_t to uint64_t, and we define it outside of
  khash.h (because the definition of kh_##name##_t already needs it.)

- get() and put() get an extra cookie parameter which is passed through to
  hash_func and hash_equal

TODO:

- The hash function's don't check for running out of memory. We should add
  that. 
  
- With uint64_t as kh_int_t, we need to increase the numbers of primes as
  well. Not done yet.
